### Project Overview 
---
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of an e-commerce company over the past year. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.

### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "sales_data.csv" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Tools Used

- Excel - Data Cleaning [Download here](https://microsoft.com)
- SQL Server - Data Analysis
- PowerBI - Creating reports

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the peak sales periods?

### Data Analysis
Include some interesting code/features worked with
- SQL queries i.e. queries

```sql
select * from table1
where name like '%Jo%';
```
### Results and Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:

1. The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season.
2. Product Category A is the best-performing category in terms of sales and revenue.
3. Customer segments with high lifetime value (LTV) should be targeted for marketing efforts.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting products in Category A.
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high-LTV customers effectively.

### Limitations
I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
